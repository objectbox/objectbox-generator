# ObjectBox Generator

Current version: 0.13.0

ObjectBox is a superfast cross-platform object-oriented database.
ObjectBox Generator produces binding code for ObjectBox C, C++ and Go APIs (more languages to be supported in the future).
This greatly simplifies using ObjectBox in your favourite language.

## Prerequisites/Installation

Install the objectbox-generator by downloading the latest binary for your OS from [releases](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-generator/releases/latest).
If you want, add it to `$PATH` for convenience.
Alternatively, instead of downloading, you can build the generator yourself by cloning this repo and running `make`.
To build yourself, you need a recent Go version, CMake and a C++11 tool chain.

## Getting started

To get started, have a look at the projects based on your language of choice:
* C and C++ [repository](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-c) and [docs](https://cpp.objectbox.io/)
* Go [repository](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-go) and [docs](https://golang.objectbox.io/)
