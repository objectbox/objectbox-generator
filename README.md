# ObjectBox Generator

Current version: 4.0.0-alpha2

ObjectBox is a superfast cross-platform object-oriented database.
ObjectBox Generator produces binding code for ObjectBox C, C++ and Go APIs (more languages to be supported in the future).
This greatly simplifies using ObjectBox in your favourite language.

## Download

Install the objectbox-generator by downloading the latest binary for your OS from [releases](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-generator/releases/latest).
If you want, add it to `$PATH` for convenience.

## Build 

If you prefer to build the generator yourself (vs. downloading), clone this repo and simply run `make`.
This will produce an "objectbox-generator" binary in the main project directory.

Build notes:

* To build yourself, you need Go, Make, CMake and a C++11 tool chain.
* To run test suite, run `make test-depend test`.
* `test-depend` needs to run only once to download objectbox core library and to build flatcc.
* A full test cycle can be triggered by `make clean all test-depend test`.

## Getting started

To get started, have a look at the specific language bindings (the approaches differ):

* C and C++ [repository](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-c) and [docs](https://cpp.objectbox.io/).
  In summary, you define a FlatBuffers schema file, and the ObjectBox Generator will create plain C++ data classes
  and helper classes that "glue" the data classes to the ObjectBox runtime library.
* Go [repository](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-go) and [docs](https://golang.objectbox.io/).
  Here, you start with Go data structs, for which the Generator generates the glue code directly.

## Development Notes

* Clean test cache: `go clean -testcache`
* Run test suite `test/comparison` with flag `-update` to update expected files.
* Run test suite `test/integration` with flag `-insource` to generate code in source may be helpful (e.g. `cd test/integration && go test ./... -insource`)
